# Project Backlog

This document tracks feature requests, bugs, and other development tasks for the TBA Pickleball Lottery project.

## Feature Requests
- [ ] Implement weekly time-driven trigger to email Accepted players and notify cancellations.
- [ ] Create clear user documentation that explains how to use the system and what it does. This documentation should include a clear, simple (non-technical) explanation of lottery. It should also include explanation of player statuses in history and explanation of reason in lottery.
- [ ] After history is updated, the list should be re-sorted alphabetically by name for easy lookup.

## Bugs
- [ ] List any known bugs here.

## Tech Debt & Chores
- [ ] List tech debt, refactoring tasks, or deployment chores here.
- [ ] Verify that lottery prioritization is working as expected. Brand new players should get top priority.
