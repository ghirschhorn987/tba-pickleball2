# Project Backlog

This document tracks feature requests, bugs, and other development tasks for the TBA Pickleball Lottery project.

## Feature Requests
- [ ] List any new feature ideas here.
- [ ] Create clear user documentation that explains how to use the system and what it does. This documentation should include a clear, simple (non-technical) explanation of lottery. It should also include explanation of player statuses in history and explanation of reason in lottery
- [ ] After history is updated, the list should be re-sorted alphabetically by name for easy lookup
- [ ] When creating a new month, ONLY one sheet should be created -- the signup sheet
- [ ] After lottery is run:
- [ ] on a weekly basis send an email to all players letting them know when they are playing or if the game is cancelled
- [ ] develop a scheme to indicate game is cancelled for a given week
